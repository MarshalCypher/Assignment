            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>
                I am a passionate technology enthusiast with a strong foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking.
                I developed an early interest in how technology shapes our daily lives and transforms 
                communities. My journey into tech began during my undergraduate studies where I discovered my love for 
                embedded systems, programming and software development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to joining ALT School, I worked on several personal projects that helped me understand the fundamentals 
                of embedded systems and web development. I have experience with various programming languages including 
                C++, Python, JavaScript and HTML/CSS. My background also includes collaborating on open-source projects and 
                participating in local tech meetups where I've learned from experienced engineers.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe in the power of continuous learning and the importance of building practical skills that can 
                make a real difference in the world. My interests extend beyond coding to include system architecture, 
                and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.
